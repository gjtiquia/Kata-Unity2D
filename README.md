# Kata - Unity2D

A kata is an exercise in karate where you repeat a form many, many times, making little improvements in each. [CodeKata](http://codekata.com/)

Just like how a martial artist repeatedly practices kata, or how a musician repeatedly practices scales, a developer should repeatedly practice code kata for coding to improve.

This repository serves as a starting point for practicing code kata for 2D games in Unity.

To start a kata, create a new branch and start any one of the kata below. You may view previous kata attempts by checking out other branches.

Below are some katas that can be practiced within an hour.
